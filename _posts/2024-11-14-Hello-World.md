# ðŸ’¡THINKING ðŸ«µ REFORM ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘£

### In this module we are going to discuss about the `MOST IMPORTANT TWO STEPS` which I was thinking to implement in my daily routine in couple of years.
<hr />

### THE `2 STEPS` golden formula to be successful.
1. ``` Create a list in a page of the thing which you wanted to make happen to you. ``` <br />
    - Such as, I will die on the land of `Mars`.
    - I will be the next Elon,
    - I will be the the next TATA. etc...
2. Create a diary (digital or something..) in which add your daily events whatever you wanted to write and also one suggestion you can can also use it as stastics to utilize it as the dilay static utilization of the work you have done in the whole day.
    - such as, one task u can add that you can also add some key points to add the values.
### And one more thing as our GURU (Sr. Recluze) `[Dr. Mohammad Nauman]` told that as a `Software Engineer` I must must crate a blog post like something to `daily upload your learning`. <br /> and also take it as the preparation for the job. as this can be treated as same as the absolutly fantastic resume. 
<hr />

# NOW LET'S MOVE TO OUR NEW SEGMENT WHICH IS SELF ANALYSIS.

### Now, as of today's self analysis I got to know that how do i get triggered unwilligly to convicted some bad stuff. 
#### `Factors affecting` these things are:
- 1. maybe, the social media because of the content that use those triggering words.
- 2.  one might be because the social bullying.
- 3. other might be when i am angry.
- 4. and also might be when i am kind of depressed or unsatisfied or unconvinced or lonely or kind of .... yeah! you got it.
- 5. and because of the repetition or reoccurance of the same conditions, movements, places, before wrong habits or ... which can trigger my neuron to take out some unwilling wrong/bad memories, which i used to or did before on those conditions...
<hr />

#### NOTE : no individual point triggers that instantly but collectivly these things with the plenty of time slowly and gradually create or unfortunatly make that particular unwilling bad decision.

# Solution:

##  Now comes the most important part which must be added in every segment i.e. `SOLUTION`.
# <center> Self-control <center>
# <center> Strictly follow time-table. <center>

- 1. prevent the consumption of the content or potential threat of being used of the trigerring word, sentences that might affect you in the back of your mind.
- 2. Increase the physical strength and strictly deny social bullying. (do not get involved in the bad/wrong groups or stand, just make distance , and be in a good one group because group are must.)
- 3. do not get over angerd.
- 4. try to avoid thinking wrong/bad in the low conditions.
- 5. ignore the past and reform th rnew present. do somethong some other activity to get distracted from that by doing talking, random activities etc..
